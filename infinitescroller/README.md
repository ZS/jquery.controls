# Overview

The Infinite Scroller is used for automatically loading (via ajax) additional results in a long list as the user scrolls to the top or bottom of a container.

Examples of one-way infinite scrollers include the Facebook Wall and Google Reader. In contrast to the plugins used across the web, the Infinite Scroller presented here allows the user to load a single page in the middle of a list and move up or down through the pages.
