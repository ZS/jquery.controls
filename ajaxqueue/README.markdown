# Overview

The Ajax Queue provides a way to keep track of concurrent and queued AJAX requests on a single webpage. Users can specify a maximum number of concurrent (in-flight) actions.
It can also be configured to force page actions to be synchronous, which is useful when requests fired by separate events may cause race conditions.
