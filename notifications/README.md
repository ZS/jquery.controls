# Overview

Notifications is used to notify the user of an action (usually ajax) which has completed in the background. These tasks may be quick ("Profile saved") or long-running ("Geocoding complete").

Notifications integrates well with ajaxqueue to provide an indication of the # of in-flight and queued actions.
