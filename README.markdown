# Example

# Usage

There are two ways to integrate the popup into production.

## Packed

The popup control depends on 2 additional jquery plugins:

1. jquery.browserdetect.js
2. [jquery.qtip.js](http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/)

If you choose popup.pack.min.js, both plugins will be included with the popup control. This is the recommended route if you have no use for browserdetect for qtip in the rest of your application.

Likewise, popup.pack.min.css contains override styles for the popup as well as the qtip.
